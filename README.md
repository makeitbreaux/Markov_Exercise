# Markov_Exercise
Exercise for Jest testing module


In this exercise, you’ll use an algorithm for generating realistic machine-made text from an original source text.

For example, if we feed in the source text of “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland”, we might get output like this:

‘You are old,’ said the Dormouse, who was talking. Alice could only see her. She is such a new pair of white kid gloves and the blades of grass, but she remembered the number of bathing machines in the kitchen that did not like the wind, and was just beginning to grow up any more if you’d like it put the Dormouse again, so she went nearer to make out that it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes in such confusion that she was looking down with it.
(that text isn’t directly in the source book, but it’s built via an algorithm to be similar to the text in the book).

Markov Machines
A Markov Machine emits output of a “Markov Chain.”

A Markov Chain is a chain of possible outcomes, given a particular “state”.

For example, consider the phrase “the cat in the hat is in the hat”. We could build a table of each word in this phrase, along with the word that comes after that phrase:

the	cat, hat, hat
cat	in
in	the, the
hat	is, null
is	in
To emit realistic-but-random text, we could pick a starting word randomly (say, “in”). Then we would:

find all words that can come after that word
pick one of those next-words randomly
if we picked null, we’ve reached the end of the chain, so stop
otherwise, restart at step 1
For example, from that simple phrase, we could find:

“in the cat in the hat”
“in the hat is in the hat”
“in the cat in the cat in the cat in the hat”
Step 0: Setup
Make a project, a Git repo, and a package.json
Add node_modules to your .gitignore
Step 1: Implement the Markov Machine
We’ve given you the start of an object-oriented Markov machine:

markov.js
/** Textual markov chain generator */


class MarkovMachine {

  /** build markov machine; read in text.*/

  constructor(text) {
    let words = text.split(/[ \r\n]+/);
    this.words = words.filter(c => c !== "");
    this.makeChains();
  }

  /** set markov chains:
   *
   *  for text of "the cat in the hat", chains will be
   *  {"the": ["cat", "hat"], "cat": ["in"], "in": ["the"], "hat": [null]} */

  makeChains() {
    // TODO
  }


  /** return random text from chains */

  makeText(numWords = 100) {
    // TODO
  }
}
The constructor function contains some code to get you started—given some input text, it splits it on spaces and linebreak characters to make a list of words. It then calls the (unimplemented) function which builds a map of chains of word → possible-next-words.

You should be able to instantiate it like this:

let mm = new MarkovMachine("the cat in the hat");
Then, whenever you want to get generated text from it:

mm.makeText();

mm.makeText(numWords=50);
Test this in the Node REPL before continuing! We’ve given you some text files to play with; you can feed these (or parts of these) into your machine to make sure it works.

Write tests — which is tricky, since this algorithm is inherently random. There are things you can test, though — what are they?
Step 2: Build the makeText.js Script
We want a script, makeText.js, that works like this:

$ node makeText.js file eggs.txt
... generated text from file 'eggs.txt' ...

$ node makeText.js url http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
... generated text from that URL ...
Make sure it handles errors (can’t read file or can’t read URL) by printing a nice and complete error message and quitting program.
